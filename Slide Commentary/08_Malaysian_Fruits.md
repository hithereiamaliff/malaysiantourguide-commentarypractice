## Potential Questions & Answers

**Q: Where can we try durian if we're curious but cautious?**
A: Many shopping malls and markets offer durian tastings where staff can help select milder varieties for first-timers. There are also durian-flavored desserts and treats that provide the flavor experience without the intense aroma and texture of the fresh fruit.

**Q: Why is durian banned in some hotels and public transportation?**
A: The strong aroma of durian can be overwhelming in enclosed spaces. The smell has been compared to everything from rotten onions to gym socks! While many people love this distinctive smell, it can be quite polarizing, which is why many hotels and public transportation systems prohibit it.

**Q: Which Malaysian fruit would you recommend for someone who's never tried tropical fruits before?**
A: Pisang Mas (Golden Banana) is an excellent introduction to Malaysian fruits—it's sweet, aromatic, and familiar enough that it won't be intimidating. For those feeling more adventurous, mangosteen offers a delicate, refreshing flavor that's rarely found outside Southeast Asia.
