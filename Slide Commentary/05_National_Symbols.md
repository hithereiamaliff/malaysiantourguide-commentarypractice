## Potential Questions & Answers

**Q: Why was the hibiscus chosen as Malaysia's national flower instead of more exotic native flowers?**
A: The hibiscus was selected for several practical and symbolic reasons. First, it grows abundantly throughout Malaysia and blooms year-round, making it visible and accessible to all Malaysians. Second, its five petals beautifully represent the five principles of our national philosophy, Rukun Negara. The vibrant red color symbolizes courage, life, and rapid growth—qualities that aligned with Malaysia's vision as a newly independent nation. While Malaysia has many exotic native flowers, the hibiscus's combination of beauty, accessibility, and symbolic meaning made it the ideal choice to represent our national character.

**Q: What's the significance of the seven figures in the National Monument?**
A: The seven bronze figures tell a powerful story of sacrifice and victory. The central figure stands triumphant, holding the Malaysian flag high, symbolizing the ultimate victory of our nation's independence. Two soldiers represent the armed forces fighting for freedom, while two others show the human cost of war—one wounded, one providing aid, reflecting compassion even in conflict. The two fallen figures represent defeated enemies during the Malayan Emergency. Together, they commemorate not just the fallen, but the spirit of determination that secured Malaysia's freedom. The monument honors both the sacrifice and the ultimate triumph of democracy over forces that threatened the nation.

**Q: Have there been any controversies surrounding the National Monument?**
A: Yes, there have been some controversies. When it was first unveiled, some criticized the monument for being designed by an American sculptor rather than a Malaysian artist. Others questioned the Western artistic style rather than incorporating traditional Malaysian elements. The monument was bombed in 1975 by communist terrorists, damaging the central figure's right arm—a significant act of desecration. Despite these controversies, over time the National Monument has become an accepted and respected symbol of national sacrifice, with annual ceremonies held there to honor Malaysia's fallen heroes. It now stands as one of the country's most recognized landmarks.
