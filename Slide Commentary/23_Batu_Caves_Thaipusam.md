## Potential Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it respectful for tourists to attend Thaipusam? Are there cultural etiquette guidelines?**
A: Yes, tourists are welcome to observe Thaipusam, and many do. To be respectful, wear modest clothing covering shoulders and knees, remove shoes when entering temple areas, ask permission before photographing individual devotees, avoid walking in front of people praying, and don't touch the kavadi carriers. The atmosphere is usually welcoming to respectful observers.

**Q: Do the devotees feel pain during the piercings and kavadi carrying?**
A: Many devotees report entering a trance-like state through prayer, meditation, and fasting before the ceremony. In this state, many say they feel no pain during the piercings. The devotees believe that their faith in Lord Murugan protects them from pain and prevents infection or bleeding. It's considered a demonstration of their devotion and spiritual focus.

**Q: When is the best time to visit Batu Caves if not during Thaipusam?**
A: Batu Caves is open year-round and is best visited in the early morning (before 9 AM) to avoid both the crowds and the heat for climbing the 272 steps. Weekdays are generally less crowded than weekends. The caves and temple are open from 6 AM to 9 PM daily, and entrance to the main temple cave is free, though there are fees for some specific attractions within the complex.
