## Potential Questions & Answers

**Q: Which of these foods would be most approachable for visitors not familiar with Malaysian cuisine?**
A: Satay is often the most approachable dish for first-time visitors as it's similar to grilled skewers found in many cultures. The flavors are aromatic but not overwhelmingly spicy, and the peanut sauce can be served on the side. Cendol is also quite accessible as a sweet dessert, though its texture might be new to some. Nasi lemak can be enjoyed with varying levels of spiciness in the sambal.

**Q: Is Malaysian food always spicy?**
A: Not all Malaysian food is spicy, though chili is a beloved ingredient. Many dishes like satay can be prepared with minimal spice, and cendol is sweet rather than spicy. Even nasi lemak can be enjoyed with less spicy sambal or with the sambal served separately. Malaysians generally appreciate that different people have different spice tolerances, so it's always possible to request less spicy versions of most dishes.

**Q: Where can we find the best versions of these dishes?**
A: For cendol, Penang is famous for its heritage versions, especially along Penang Road where you'll find the famous Teochew cendol. Nasi lemak is found everywhere from street vendors to high-end restaurants, but many locals swear by simple roadside stalls that specialize in just this dish, particularly those in Kampung Baru in Kuala Lumpur. For satay, Kajang (near Kuala Lumpur) is considered the satay capital of Malaysia with numerous dedicated satay restaurants.
